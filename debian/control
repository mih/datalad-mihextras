Description: staging area for future DataLad additions
 This DataLad extension ships special interest functionality or drafts of
 future additions to DataLad proper. Its purpose is to test-drive new
 functionality in the wild without making any promises on longevity or
 stability. Once a certain level of maturity has been reached, most
 functionality will move to more appropriate places, like topical
 extensions or even DataLad proper.
