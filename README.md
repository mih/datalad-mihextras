DataLad extension with special interest functionality or drafts of future
additions to DataLad proper.

There is a staging area to test-drive new functionality in the wild without
making any promises on longevity or stability. Once a certain level of maturity
has been reached, most functionality will move to more appropriate places, like
topical extensions or even DataLad proper.
